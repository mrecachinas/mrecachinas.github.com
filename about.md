# Hi, I'm Mike!
<section>
<p>I'm a software engineer at <a href="http://www.lgsinnovations.com/about/axios/">Axios, Inc. (an LGS Innovations Company)</a> where I've been building various digital signal processing systems and machine learning-based systems leveraging languages like Python, C++, and Java, and other technologies (e.g., databases, tools, frameworks, etc.), such as MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Neo4j, CUDA, Docker, RabbitMQ, etc.</p>

<p>I graduated from the <a href="http://www.virginia.edu">University of Virginia</a> in 2014 with a Bachelor of Science in <a href="http://www.ece.virginia.edu">Electrical Engineering</a> and a second major in <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu">Computer Science</a> and in 2016 with a Master of Engineering in <a href="http://www.ece.virginia.edu">Electrical Engineering</a> on the topic of approximating noise characterization in microwave and millimeter devices. I had the pleasure of conducting research under <a href="http://www.ece.virginia.edu/faculty/weikle.html">Bobby Weikle</a>. I have been conducting side research with <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~weimer">Wes Weimer</a> on improving software properties using genetic algorithms.</p>
<p>On the side, I have a (fairly new and budding) passion for photography, food (especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_gastronomy">molecular gastronomy</a>), and travel. I'm also absolutely in love with my puppy (and primary photography subject), Ellie, and my fianc√©e, <a href="https://erinveasey.github.io">Erin</a>.</p>
