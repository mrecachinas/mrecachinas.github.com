Hi, I'm Mike
-------------
I'm a software engineer at `LGS Labs at CACI <https://www.caci.com/bit-systems/>`_,
where I've been building various large-scale digital signal processing systems and
machine learning based recommender systems for a variety of customers. I'm also the current
maintainer for the DSP JavaScript-based plotting library `SigPlot.js <https://github.com/lgsinnovations/sigplot>`_ and related packages.

Day-to-day, you'll hear me use words such as "prior," "Cram√©r-Rao," .

I graduated from the `University of Virginia <https://www.virginia.edu/>`_ in 2014 with a Bachelor of Science
in `Electrical Engineering <https://www.ece.virginia.edu/>`_, a second major in `Computer Science <https://www.cs.virginia.edu/>`_, and a minor in
`Applied Mathematics <https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/engineering-and-society/academics/applied-math>`_.
I graduated a second time from the University of Virginia
in 2016 with a Master of Engineering in `Electrical Engineering <>`_ on the topic of
approximating noise waves in microwave and millimeter devices, building off of `prior work by Dr. Scott Wedge <https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/3581/>`_. I had the
pleasure of conducting research under `Dr. Bobby Weikle <https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/robert-m-weikle-ii>`_. In addition, I
researched leveraging `genetic algorithms <>`_ for `multi-objective optimization <>`_
problems such as visual fidelity versus latency in path tracers (e.g.
`PBRT <https://www.pbrt.org/>`_) with Drs. `Westley Weimer <https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~weimerw/>`_,
`Jason Lawrence <https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonlawrence2/>`_, and `Jon Dorn <https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~jad5ju/>`_.

On the side, I have a passion for photography, `food <>`_, and travel. I'm also
absolutely in love with my dog
`Poppy <https://www.instagram.com/jalapenopoppy/>`_ and my incredibly brilliant wife,
`Erin <https://erin.recachinas.dev>`_.

Rest in Peace, `Eleanor "Ellie" Recachinas <https://www.instagram.com/smellyelliebelly/>`_.
